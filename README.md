# ccxg-collostructional
R scripts for the collostructional analysis of a ccxg propbank-annotated file.

## How to run
Run the scripts in the following order:
1. load_data.R
2. utils.R
3. clean_data.R
4. run.analysis.R

## run.analysis.R
When you run the "run.analysis.R" script it will ask you for a file to analyse. It currently works with lemma / roleset _ distinctive csv files.
